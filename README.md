# Crop Yield Prediction AI

Using TensorFlow and the in-built Keras library, this code will be able to predict Crop Yields for various crops. We will be using a dataset on kaggle. You can find it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patelris/crop-yield-prediction-dataset)  

In order to run this model on your own machine, first clone the repository from github, then you can open it with whatever IDE you wish to use. Then run the following commands:

Windows:

```

py -3 -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

Mac/Linux:

```

python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

Then you can run the notebook with the run feature in your IDE
